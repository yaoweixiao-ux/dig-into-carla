# Dig into Carla

Dig into Carla is mainly to help learning Carla simulator system. We first introduce the functions of each module in detail, and then analyzed the code of each module. If you like autonomous driving simulator and want to learn it, let's start this project and discuss anything you want to know!

# Getting Started

If you are like me before and donâ€™t know how to start the Carla project. Here are some suggestions.

1. First understand the basic module functions. If you are not clear about the general function of the module, it's difficult for you to understand what's the code doing. Here is an beginner level tutorial
2. Then you need to understand the specific methods according to the module, which will be documented in this tutorial. We will analyze the code in depth next. You can learn step by step according to our tutorial.
3. I know it will be a painful process, especially when you are first learning Apollo. If you persist in asking questions and studying, it will become easier in 1-2 months.
4. Last but not least, the method in Apollo is almost perfect, but there will be some problems. Try to implement and improve it, find papers, try the latest methods, and hone your skills. I believe you will enjoy this process.
